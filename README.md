*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
          My second task, I designed and developed a personal portfolio website to represent a front-end web developer. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive interface using HTML and CSS, that could effectively showcase my skills, previous projects, and contact information — all in a single, scrollable page.

The webpage starts with a sticky header positioned at the top of the page, styled with a deep blue-violet background (#4f46e5) and white text for maximum contrast. The header includes a site logo ("Priya the Developer") on the left and a horizontal navigation bar on the right with links that smoothly scroll to different sections: About, Projects, and Contact. The navigation links also feature a subtle underline hover effect, achieved with CSS pseudo-elements (::after) and smooth transitions to enhance user interaction.

Beneath the header, the hero section functions as the landing area of the site. It uses a soft, diagonal gradient background (#e0e7ff to #c3dafe) and is centered both vertically and horizontally. The hero includes a headline introducing the developer, a short description, and optional room for a call-to-action button (commented in CSS as .button). The font sizes and spacing are adjusted to ensure visual hierarchy and good readability on all devices.

Next is the About section, which is centered and uses slightly larger body text to share a brief introduction about the developer's skillset and passion. This section is designed with a maximum width and automatic horizontal margin to keep the content readable, even on large screens. The typography is clean, with subtle colors (#555) used for contrast against the white background.

The Projects section follows, and it uses CSS Grid to display project cards in a responsive layout. Each project card includes a title and a short description. The grid layout automatically adjusts from three columns on desktop to one column on mobile, using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)). Cards have soft shadows, hover lift effects (transform: translateY(-8px)), and clean padding to create a consistent, modern UI. Four sample projects are listed: a Quiz App, a Chat App, a Portfolio Website, and an E-learning Platform UI — each representing different areas of frontend development.

The Contact section is placed at the bottom and includes a short paragraph encouraging visitors to reach out via email, along with a mailto link (developer@example.com). Like the other sections, it’s centered and padded for clarity, with hover effects on the email link that change its color and underline it for better user feedback.

Finally, the footer spans the width of the page and uses a darker background (#333) with muted text color (#bbb) to clearly separate it from the main content. It contains a simple copyright message.

Throughout the site, media queries are used to ensure full responsiveness on tablets and phones. Navigation stacks vertically on small screens, font sizes and paddings are adjusted, and the grid layout adapts for mobile readability.

In summary, this webpage is a fully responsive, visually appealing portfolio site designed with clean HTML5 and CSS3. It reflects professional UI principles and provides a well-organized layout that works smoothly across devices.
