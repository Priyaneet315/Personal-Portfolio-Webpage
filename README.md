*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
         As my third task, I designed and built a personal portfolio website for a front-end web developer. The goal was to create a neat, modern interface with responsive features using HTML and CSS. The site showcases the developer's skills, past works, and contact details all on one scrollable page.

The webpage starts with a sticky header at the top. It has a deep blue-violet background (#4f46e5) with white text for a strong contrast. The site logo on the left says "Priya the Developer." To the right is a horizontal navigation bar with internal links that smooth-scroll to different sections: About, Projects, and Contact. A subtle underline effect appears on the navigation links when hovered over, created with CSS pseudo-elements (::after). This provides a smooth transition to improve user interaction.

Just below the header is the hero section, which also serves as the landing section of the site. It features a soft gradient that fades diagonally from #e0e7ff to #c3dafe, centered both vertically and horizontally. This section includes a headline introducing the developer, a short description, and space for a call-to-action button (the button is commented out in the CSS). I adjusted font sizes and spacing to ensure visual hierarchy and readability on all devices.

Next is the About section, which is centered and uses slightly larger body text to provide a brief introduction about the developer’s skills and passions. This section has a maximum width and automatic horizontal margins to keep the content readable, even on large screens. The typography is clean, with subtle colors (#555) for contrast against the white background.

The Projects section follows and uses CSS Grid to display project cards in a responsive layout. Each card includes a title and a short description. The grid layout adjusts automatically from three columns on desktop to one column on mobile, using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)). Cards have soft shadows, lift effects on hover (transform: translateY(-8px)), and clean padding to create a consistent, modern look. Four sample projects are listed: a Quiz App, a Chat App, a Portfolio Website, and an E-learning Platform UI, each representing different areas of front-end development.

The Contact section is at the bottom and features a short paragraph encouraging visitors to reach out via email, along with a mailto link (developer@example.com). Like the other sections, it’s centered and padded for clarity. The email link changes color and gets an underline on hover to provide better feedback.

Finally, the footer spans the full width of the page, using a darker background (#333) with muted text color (#bbb) to clearly separate it from the main content. It contains a simple copyright message.

Throughout the site, media queries are used to ensure full responsiveness on tablets and phones. Navigation stacks vertically on small screens, and I adjusted font sizes and paddings. The grid layout adapts for mobile readability.

In summary, this webpage is a fully responsive and visually appealing portfolio site created with clean HTML5 and CSS3. It reflects solid UI principles and provides an organized layout that works smoothly across devices.
